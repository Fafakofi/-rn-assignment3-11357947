This was a reallyexciting project to work on. I used a couple of core components like the;

1. View: It is like a container that helps to structure andstyle the components of our app
2. Text: it is used to display texts in the app. without this texts cannot be displayed
3. ScrollView: Itallows us to create a scrolable area in the app. it can be very useful when contents exceeds the screen size.
4. TextInput: This allows users to input text in the app. it is commonly used in searchbars and forms to get neccessary information from the user
5. Stylesheet: This is use to creates styles in the app to make the app look very nice and appealing to the user
6. Button: It is ised to create a clickable button in the app
7. Flatlist: It is an efficient way of showing a long list of data on the app. 
8. Image: This is used to display images in the app.
